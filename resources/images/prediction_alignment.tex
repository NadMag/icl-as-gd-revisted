  \caption{
    Partition of prediction changes with regards to the zero-shot setting induced by ICL and FT.
    For each task we evaluate both methods on the same validation set.
    Correct changes are examples that are misclassified in the ZSL setting and are correctly classified following the prediction update.
    incorrect changes are examples whose prediction is changed from the ZSL setting into an incorrect label.
